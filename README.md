Welcome to your first project Midas.

Incase you're wondering who i am, i am you (but from the past). You can call me the NarraTOR or N-TOR for short.
I have watched you learn, grow, and conquer various concepts and finally you are here, at the very first challenge you will face in becoming Midas the Web Dev.
Lets get down to it, shall we?

------------------------------

Your task is simple.

Make use of all that you have learned thus far as part of Odins training to create a cookbook website.
For someone that always loved to bake, this should be a chance to test the limits of your creativity and find artistic expression through code.

You can find all other relevant info in "project 1" of the "Foundations path"

Happy coding.
