        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h4>Steeping the Tea</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a pan pour the water.</li>
                <li>Heat the pan on a medium flame and let the water come to a boil.</li>
                <li>Once the water comes to a boil, turn off the heat and add 2 tablespoons black tea powder.</li>
                <li>Add sugar.  Mix very well.</li>
                <li>Let the tea leaves steep in the water for 4 to 5 minutes. For a lighter tea flavor, you can steep for 2 to 3 minutes. <br><em>If using green tea, steep for 2 minutes.</em></li>
                <li>After the tea is steeped in the hot water, then add 3 tablespoons lemon juice. For a more lemony taste, you can opt to add 4 tablespoons lemon juice.</li>
                <li>Stir with a spoon.</li>
                <li>Then using a tea strainer, strain the lemon tea in a steel or glass jar. The glass jar should be able to handle the heat.</li>
                <li>Let the lemon tea cool at room temperature. Later you can chill it in the fridge.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h4>Making Iced Tea</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>While serving, add 4 to 5 ice cubes in a glass or glasses. You can add less or more as per your preference. <br>If using cold iced tea from the refrigerator, then you can skip adding ice cubes.</li>
                <li>Also add 1 to 2 lemon slices. Adding lemon slices is optional.</li>
                <li>Pour the lemon tea in the glass or glasses.</li>
                <li>Garnish with a lemon slice or a sprig of mint leaves.</li>
                <li>Serve Lemon Iced Tea immediately. While drinking do stir lemon iced tea with a stirrer or a spoon.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h4>Storage</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>If you are not planning to serve ice tea on the same day, then keep it in the fridge.</li>
                <li>It keeps well for 2 to 3 days when refrigerated. Do not keep it outside as it may start to ferment.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
