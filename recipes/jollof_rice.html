        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season the steak with ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon black pepper. Cook until browned on the outside, about 5 minutes, stirring a couple times. Remove the steak and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pot used to cook the steak, add the onions with the remaining olive oil and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the rice on top of the cooked onions along with tomato paste, remaining salt and pepper, thyme, ginger and crushed red pepper; stir to combine until the rice is red in color and lightly toasted.</li>
            <li>Add the diced tomatoes and green pepper along with the bay leaves on top of the rice. Return the cooked steak to the pot along with the water.</li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients together, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 15 minutes, until rice is fully cooked. Remove from heat and allow the steam to continue cooking the rice for 5-10 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Fluff the rice, sprinkle with fresh parsley and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
